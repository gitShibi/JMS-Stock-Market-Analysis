‚Ä¢	10-day Moving Average (MA_10)
‚Ä¢	50-day Moving Average (MA_50)
‚Ä¢	Relative Strength Index (RSI)
‚Ä¢	Trading Volume
Stationarity Check & Differencing
Time series models require stationarity. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test was used to assess stationarity:
‚úî Null Hypothesis (H0): The series is non-stationary
‚úî Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The series is stationary
Initially, the test indicated non-stationarity, so first-order differencing was applied (df.diff()), making the data stationary. The ADF test was repeated after differencing to confirm stationarity.


Model Selection & Training
1. Initial ARIMAX Model
An ARIMAX model was implemented using the SARIMAX function from statsmodels. The model's components include:
‚Ä¢	(p, d, q) = (1,1,1):
o	p (Autoregressive Order): 1
o	d (Differencing Order): 1 (to handle stationarity)
o	q (Moving Average Order): 1
‚Ä¢	Seasonal Order (0,0,0,0): No seasonality in the model.
‚Ä¢	Exogenous Variables (X_train): The technical indicators were included to enhance predictions.
The model was trained on 80% of the dataset, while 20% was used for testing.
2. Model Evaluation
The initial ARIMAX model was evaluated using:
‚Ä¢	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
‚Ä¢	Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
‚Ä¢	Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
The predicted stock prices followed the general trend of actual prices but required fine-tuning.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing ARIMAX Model
To improve performance, the Auto ARIMA function (auto_arima) was used to determine the optimal (p, d, q) parameters.
‚úî Best Parameters Found: (p, d, q) = (3,2,1)
A final ARIMAX model was trained using these optimized parameters:
final_model = SARIMAX(y_train, exog=X_train, order=(3,2,1), seasonal_order=(0,0,0,0)) final_model_fit = final_model.fit()
Final Model Evaluation & Results
The final model was tested on unseen data, and its performance metrics were recalculated:
üìå RMSE: Lower RMSE indicates reduced error in stock price predictions.
üìå MAE: Measures the average absolute error in predictions.
üìå MAPE: Expresses error as a percentage‚Äîlower values indicate better accuracy.
‚úî The Optimized ARIMAX model showed improved accuracy compared to the initial model.
Visualization & Insights
A comparison plot of actual vs. predicted stock prices was created:
üîπ Blue Line: Actual prices
üîπ Red Line: Predicted prices
 
                                                             Figure 6 Actual vs Predicted price with ARIMAX
The final model captured stock price trends more accurately than the initial model, but some deviations remained.
Conclusion & Future Improvements
The ARIMAX model effectively leveraged exogenous variables to enhance stock price predictions. However, further refinements can be made:
üîπ Feature Engineering: Adding more indicators like MACD or Bollinger Bands.
