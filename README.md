This predictive modeling process focuses on forecasting the Short Range,medium-range and Large range stock prices for Airbnb (ABNB), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Expedia (EXPE), and Marriott (MAR) using the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network and ARIMA(Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) The models were trained on historical price data, and their performance was evaluated using RMSE and R-squared metrics plus hyper parameter tuning was conducted to optimize predictions. The goal is to build a reliable model that captures stock price trends using historical data, technical indicators, and deep learning.
1.	LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory (for deep learning
Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing
To enhance model performance, key technical indicators were calculated and added as features:
‚Ä¢	Moving Averages (MA):
o	10-day Moving Average (MA_10)
o	50-day Moving Average (MA_50)
‚Ä¢	Relative Strength Index (RSI):
o	Measures stock momentum over a 14-day period
‚Ä¢	Volume was also considered as a feature.
The data set underwent preprocessing:
‚úî Handling Missing & Infinite Values: NaNs were replaced with column means.
‚úî Normalization: MinMaxScaler was used to scale data between 0 and 1 for better LSTM performance.
‚úî Sequence Creation: The past 60 days' data was used to predict the next day's stock price.

LSTM Model Selection and Training
The predictive model is based on an LSTM network, chosen for its ability to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data.

Model Architecture
‚Ä¢	Input Size: 5 (Close Price, MA_10, MA_50, RSI, Volume)
‚Ä¢	Hidden Layers: 2 LSTM layers with 64 units each
‚Ä¢	Dropout: 20% to prevent overfitting
‚Ä¢	Fully Connected (FC) Layer: Outputs a single predicted stock price
Training Process
‚Ä¢	Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure prediction accuracy
‚Ä¢	Optimizer: Adam Optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001
‚Ä¢	Epochs: 50 iterations
During training, the model minimized loss by updating weights using backpropagation.
Model Evaluation and Results
The model was tested on unseen data (20% of the dataset). The performance was evaluated using:
‚Ä¢	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures absolute error in stock price predictions.
‚Ä¢	Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of prediction errors.
‚Ä¢	Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): Indicates how much percentage error exists in predictions.
 
                                                                     Figure 5 Actual vs Predicted price with LSTM
Findings
‚úî Predicted vs. Actual Prices: The LSTM model was able to follow the actual price trend with reasonable accuracy.
‚úî RMSE, MAE, and MAPE Results: Provided insight into prediction errors, highlighting areas for improvement.
‚úî MAPE: A lower percentage means better accuracy in forecasting.

The LSTM-based model successfully captured All-range stock price trends, leveraging historical data and technical indicators. While the results show promising accuracy, further optimizations through hyper parameter tuning and feature engineering can improve prediction robustness. This model serves as a strong foundation for developing more advanced financial forecasting tools.


Fine-Tuning & Future Enhancements
To improve the model's performance:
üîπ Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjusting the number of LSTM layers, units, and learning rate.

2.	ARIMA: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing
To ensure the dataset is suitable for time series forecasting, the following preprocessing steps were performed:
Feature Selection
The dataset includes the target variable (Close price) and four technical indicators as features:
‚Ä¢	10-day Moving Average (MA_10)
‚Ä¢	50-day Moving Average (MA_50)
‚Ä¢	Relative Strength Index (RSI)
‚Ä¢	Trading Volume
Stationarity Check & Differencing
Time series models require stationarity. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test was used to assess stationarity:
‚úî Null Hypothesis (H0): The series is non-stationary
‚úî Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The series is stationary
Initially, the test indicated non-stationarity, so first-order differencing was applied (df.diff()), making the data stationary. The ADF test was repeated after differencing to confirm stationarity.


Model Selection & Training
1. Initial ARIMAX Model
An ARIMAX model was implemented using the SARIMAX function from statsmodels. The model's components include:
‚Ä¢	(p, d, q) = (1,1,1):
o	p (Autoregressive Order): 1
o	d (Differencing Order): 1 (to handle stationarity)
o	q (Moving Average Order): 1
‚Ä¢	Seasonal Order (0,0,0,0): No seasonality in the model.
‚Ä¢	Exogenous Variables (X_train): The technical indicators were included to enhance predictions.
The model was trained on 80% of the dataset, while 20% was used for testing.
2. Model Evaluation
The initial ARIMAX model was evaluated using:
‚Ä¢	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
‚Ä¢	Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
‚Ä¢	Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
The predicted stock prices followed the general trend of actual prices but required fine-tuning.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing ARIMAX Model
To improve performance, the Auto ARIMA function (auto_arima) was used to determine the optimal (p, d, q) parameters.
‚úî Best Parameters Found: (p, d, q) = (3,2,1)
A final ARIMAX model was trained using these optimized parameters:
final_model = SARIMAX(y_train, exog=X_train, order=(3,2,1), seasonal_order=(0,0,0,0)) final_model_fit = final_model.fit()
Final Model Evaluation & Results
The final model was tested on unseen data, and its performance metrics were recalculated:
üìå RMSE: Lower RMSE indicates reduced error in stock price predictions.
üìå MAE: Measures the average absolute error in predictions.
üìå MAPE: Expresses error as a percentage‚Äîlower values indicate better accuracy.
‚úî The Optimized ARIMAX model showed improved accuracy compared to the initial model.
Visualization & Insights
A comparison plot of actual vs. predicted stock prices was created:
üîπ Blue Line: Actual prices
üîπ Red Line: Predicted prices
 
                                                             Figure 6 Actual vs Predicted price with ARIMAX
The final model captured stock price trends more accurately than the initial model, but some deviations remained.
Conclusion & Future Improvements
The ARIMAX model effectively leveraged exogenous variables to enhance stock price predictions. However, further refinements can be made:
üîπ Feature Engineering: Adding more indicators like MACD or Bollinger Bands.
